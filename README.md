# Clarks

It includes: 
* The assessment brief
* Simulated data in a .csv file
* Work in R to analyse the data
* Presentation of initial results and recomendations

The work in R is presented in R notebook format. This allows commentry alongside chunks of code. It also produces an html output of the commentry along with the code and the code output. Both can be useful for sharing with people depending on theire background and familiarity with R.
